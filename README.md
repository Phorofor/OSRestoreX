# OSRestoreX and Termianl
A semi-restore Alternative for iOS 10.

Install from Cydia https://repo.jailbreakhub.org.

## Steps for installation:
OSRestore does all the heavy lifting for you, so all you need to do is follow these easy steps:

1. Install OSRestore (Will get everything set up for a restore. This can take up to 5 minutes so be paitent.)
2. Go into settings app and 'Erase all Content and Settings'
3. Enjoy your freshly restored device on a Jailbreakable firmware!

This will remove all tweaks from your device and reverse stashing by Coolstars Stashing for 9.3.3-10. It will do quite a bit to remove all un-needed files from your device to make for a fresher install as best as it can. It will also remove mobilesubstrate from your device so dpkg should handle removal of leftover files. (Including Anemone themes and their data.)

## Command Line Utility:
Also on this page is command line utility; This can be run over SSH or via MTerminal. It is exactly the same as the default package but it can be triggered when you'd prefer rather than having to run it immideatley.

**But be warned:** This can be triggered by any ol' Cydia tweak with a postinst script so I'd be **VERY** careful if you install this although I reccomend you don't. You can trigger OSRestore by typing `osrestore` from the command line.

### DISCLAIMER:

I have only tried this on iOS 10.2 and 10.1.1 and OSRestore may not be compatible with other firmwares. I am not responsible for any damage to your device.

Although I work hard to make sure OSRestore works perfectly, bugs may slip through and issues may happen. If someting happens feel free to PM me on reddit /u/nathanaccidentally. Thanks.
