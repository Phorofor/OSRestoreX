# OSRestore 10
A Cydia Eraser Alternative for iOS 10.

~~Install from Cydia https://nathanaccidentally.github.io.~~ **OSRestore is currently in closed beta on reddit and is not currently on any repo. Please be paitent while I continue to make this the best tweak I can. Thank you.**

## Steps for installation:
OSRestore does all the heavy lifting for you, so all you need to do is follow these easy steps:

1. Install OSRestore (Will get everything set up for a restore. This can take up to 5 minutes so be paitent.)
2. Go into settings app and 'Erase all Content and Settings'
3. Enjoy your freshly restored device on a Jailbreakable firmware!

This will remove all tweaks from your device and reverse stashing by Coolstars Stashing for 9.3.3-10. It will do quite a bit to remove all un-needed files from your device to make for a fresher install as best as it can. It will also remove mobilesubstrate from your device so dpkg should handle removal of leftover files. (Including Anemone themes and their data.)

### DISCLAIMER:

I have only tried this on iOS 10.2 and 10.1.1 and OSRestore may not be compatible with other firmwares. I am not responsible for any damage to your device.

Although I work hard to make sure OSRestore works perfectly, bugs may slip through and issues may happen. If someting happens feel free to PM me on reddit /u/nathanaccidentally. Thanks.
